# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence that extract patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. The key focus of ML is to allow computer systems to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed or human intervention.

There are various ML algorithms, techniques and methods that can be used to build models for solving real-life problems by using data.
