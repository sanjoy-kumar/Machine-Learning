Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.


Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or not there is a relationship between the variables of interest.
